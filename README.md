# GoBrawl - Brawl Stars tracking and analytics

GoBrawl is a prototype project to track and analyze players on Supercell's game Brawl Stars. Using the Brawl Stars API with a GraphQL interface on the backend, stored using MongoDB for long term analytics.

<br/>
This project is meant to provide a more conclusive history of players' game record to provide better analytics than what is currently available. I intent to keep working on the backend for the majority of this project, and eventually provide a front-end and full user experience if the project works as I hope it will.

Unfortunatly due to time contraints this may take a long time, and due to how fast mobile games like this move, I may be too late when I am finished. However I hope in the mean time I can create something to push my skills in web development, and most importantly with this project, web deployment and operations.
